Roman Numerals
==============

Write a method that converts an integer to its Roman numeral equivalent, i.e., 476 => 'CDLXXVI'.

For reference, these are the building blocks for how we encode numbers with Roman numerals:

| Roman Numeral | Arabic Numeral |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| I             | 1              |
| V             | 5              |
| X             | 10             |
| L             | 50             |
| C             | 100            |
| D             | 500            |
| M             | 1000           |

### Roman Numerals as Representation

Have you ever seen a 5? I don't mean the symbol we write on a piece of paper or print to a screen, but an actual, honest-to-goodness 5?

Of course not. You've seen things that somehow embody five: five apples, five fingers, five weekdays on the calendar, a scrap of paper with "5" written on it, and so forth. Think of all the ways you can represent the integer 5.

Symbols like 5, "five", V, and IIIII are one way. If you asked a three-year-old, they might hold up the five fingers on their hand or pull out five pennies from their pocket. Computers encode numbers as a sequence of 0s and 1s called [binary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number).

[The map is not the territory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation), as they say.
